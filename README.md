# Project context 

- Zenya is developing a new module called Boost to boost user knowledge in a nonintrusive way.

- The Boost module provides tools to deliver microlearning to users over time.

- The goal of this project is to develop a working concept for generating a video based on a Dutch piece of text.

- The solution should be scalable to support 1.5M Zenya users and future growth, support multiple tenants, be GDPR compliant, and deployable on Azure.

- Integration with Zenya is not part of this project, and cost management should be done by using existing AI/NLP services on Zenya SaaS infrastructure.
